Ideas

import .arx or .zip

- if .zip then -- unzip
check for one.arx and max one directory

- if files selected then show files as links ???




Export viewed file as new .arx
or .csv or .json or .xml

Convert column of 0,1,2 == "New","Open","Closed" (hand defined)
Info is stored in same folder/name of the export file -- so it would be reusable.


Possibly create a naming pack - to use with .arx load

So -- load your .arx,

Then load - view_rules.

view_rules

(rename columns)
(map values to "other values")
(possibly a "query" -- only show where "Status == 1")




Query 
(select status field -- gives list of choices -- select one or two ???)

Possibly - query by regex


Import into ARS server 
(Needs access to server)


Import as merge -- or import as submit or import as modify or - delete matching???


Individual record modify (in memory) - so when you export the def as arx -- you get "your version"

Rename to ARX Works 

Ability to move columns left right in display.

Ability to sort columns



"Analyze" -- ability to get a data feel - by question.

"Analyze" -- ability to pivot table two columns
